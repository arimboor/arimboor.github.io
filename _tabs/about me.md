Hey there! I'm Jinto Antony (Joe). I spend quite a bit of time on security stuff, trying to figure out how to make things simple so everyone can understand. ðŸ¤” I have over 15 years of professional experience in enterprise security, incident response, and digital forensics. Currently, I'm working as a Senior Incident Response Consultant.
