### I. Zeek App for Theat Hunting 

The **Zeek App for Hunting** uses open-source Zeek (formerly known as BRO) logs to give you insights into network traffic, which can be super useful for threat hunting and incident response. It's available on the Splunk Marketplace and has already been downloaded over 1,800 times. If you're using Zeek sensors for network forensics, it's definitely worth checking out!
